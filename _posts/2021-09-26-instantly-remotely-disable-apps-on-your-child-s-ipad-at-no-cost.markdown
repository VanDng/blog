#### Built-in solution

You may know that iOS or iPadOS has a built-in function named Screen Time that you can use to control your child’s time spending on the iPad. Although the control is very limited, it’s still better than nothing.

#### 3rd-party Apps

Using Screen Time for a while, I was wondering if there is any app providing such function but more advanced, and starting to google about it. After some tries, I found out the name of this kind of apps, Parental Control Apps.

There are so many different choices with different prices and user interfaces but due to the restriction of Apple, those apps have the same limitation, so their features are quite similar to each other.

#### What’s special?

One of the features I am most satisfied with is that to remotely set different periods of time on a day to enable/disable apps. Remotely means you can use your device (a laptop, an iPad/iPhone) to manage, you do not need to access your child’s iPad.

You can not do that with Screen Time.

#### Apps choices

Obviously, I can not try all apps on the market, I read some reviews, comparisons and pick some apps that I feel more attractive. Most of the apps offer a period of trial, after that, you have to pay to continue using it.

Standing out of them, there is an app called “OurPact” that allows you to use it completely free forever but very limited or you can pay to unlock more advanced features, I name it as OurPact’s free version.

I choose OurPact’s free version.

#### Experience

The app goes smoothly all the time, the graphic user interface is quite simple and easy to navigate.

Among the apps I tried, it provides the best experience.

#### Expectation

What I want is really simple:  
1. Instantly disable/enable apps on the target iPad.  
2. Remotely.  
3. Free of use.

The first two expectations are one of the main features provided by OurPact. There is two buttons “BLOCK” and “GRANT” to quickly instantly disable or enable apps right on the center main screen.

The problem is that OurPact’s free version allows you to activate instant blocking only 5 times per month.

Luckily, it allows you to create 1 schedule and does not limit the number of times of granting activation.

Then, you have two solutions:  
1. Schedule to disable apps the whole day. Activate/Inactivate granting whenever you want to enable/disable apps.  
2. Schedule to disable apps the whole day. Disable/enable the schedule whenever you want to continue disabling or not.

Although OurPact’s free version supports only 1 device (the parent’s device does not count), 1 device is enough for me.

All expectations are fulfilled.

Here, I am going to give you some answers to questions relating to parental apps in general.

#### Privacy concern

In order to complete the setup of OurPact or Parental Control apps, you have to install an MDM Profile (<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209435>) provided by the app manufacturers. It’s likely you give them permission to manage (and access) your child’s devices.

If you do not trust them, do not use their products. That’s it.

#### Prevent children from uninstalling Parental Control Apps

You simply can not prevent your children from uninstalling parental control apps because parental control apps can not fully take over your child’s iPad due to the restriction of Apple.

If you have any questions or concerns, leave a comment. I might be able to help you.
