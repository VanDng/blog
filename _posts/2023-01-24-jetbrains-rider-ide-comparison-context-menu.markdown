  I really like how JetBrains Rider IDE compares files and folders. The way differences are aligned and highlighted is very great. However, I can only launch the diff feature outside of the IDE by command line which is not convenient to me.

So that I created a shell extension to add context menus for launching the Rider diff feature based on how users select files and folders.
